The Spring PetClinic repository is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to build a web-based interface for managing a pet clinic. It includes functionalities for managing pets, owners, and visits.

## Main Components

### Model Entities

Model Entities represent the core data structures in the application, encapsulating the properties and behaviors of real-world objects such as pets, owners, and visits. They are used to map the application's data to the database and facilitate data manipulation and retrieval.

### System Controllers

System Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and mapping them to the appropriate service methods. They define endpoints and manage the flow of data between the client and the server. For example, the WelcomeController handles requests to the root URL and returns the 'welcome' view, while the CrashController demonstrates error handling by throwing an exception when a specific endpoint is accessed.
